** ## For Horiseon I believe that I met the Criteria listed above. I made a functional webpage for screen readers by distinguishing all parts of the webpage using semantic elements. I did keep the original design yet put in some style with my own hint of love. The header and keeping the original multi-color theme through me off for a little so I challenged myself to keep the design using a different method...(which ended up being extremely simple). The most difficult issue I kept running into was, the footer kept appearing in the top right corner above my aside block and figuring that out took me some research, which I found that almost all the responses to help answer fellow coders with the same issues used div elements all over the place. It was frustrating yet a good experience to learn from. To not get discouraged and seeing that showed how refactoring companies webpages could be a career in itself. Lastly I would say that I am still having difficulty with having elements shift when the screen size changes and I understand that will happen but I am currently working on something outside of the bootcamp to grasp and understand how to control the way the page decides to layout on different screen sizes. Researching on google and using their dev tools to tweak the css has been a blast. Im really looking forward to proceeding with this course and hope that the end result can be what I am hoping for.
