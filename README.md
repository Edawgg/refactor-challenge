** ## For Horiseon's webpage refactor, challenge #1, I believe that I met the Criteria listed Bellow. I made a functional webpage for screen readers by distinguishing all parts of the webpage using semantic elements. I did keep the original design yet put in some style with my own hint of love. Having a clear bold title and researching how search engines organize their results, is simple yet competitive. I'd appreciate feedback on my code, if how I format the code itself, and what I could have done to clean it up more. I believe the structure was correct. All .jpg and .png have alt attributes. Headings were in order and I feel ok about labelling the icons as fig w/ figcaption instead of h3 grouped together. To show that I am utilizing w3 schools for sure.

My experience as a student being brand new to coding- The original header and keeping the multi-color theme threw me off for a little, I knew i had to remove the span tag but to replace it with what and avoiding making it 3 seperate elements. So I challenged myself to keep the design using a different method...(which ended up being extremely simple). The most difficult issue I kept running into was, the footer kept appearing in the top right corner above my aside block and figuring that out took some research, which I found that almost all the responses to help answer fellow coders with the same issues used div elements all over the place. It was frustrating yet a good experience to learn from. To not get discouraged and seeing that showed how refactoring companies webpages could be a career in itself. Lastly I would say that I am still having difficulty with having elements shift when the screen size changes and I understand that will happen but I am currently working on something outside of the bootcamp to grasp and understand how to control the way the page decides to layout on different screen sizes. (Funny how if I would have viewed the lessons for class 3/21, id know why "youll love flexbox" was being said.)
Instead of preparing for todays lesson. I zoned in on terminal, git and github, and devTools. Researching on google and using their dev tools to tweak the css has been a blast not having an external monitor makes this my new best friend. Im really looking forward to proceeding with this course and hope that the end result can be what I am hoping for.
