# Description of this assignment
    Refactoring a webpages code requires a knowledge of the original languages used to create the page. Html was used to build the layout using elements and attributes and CSS for the styling of those elements and any content contained within them. The Html in this page did not have user accessability. A common example throughout the code is the original Author used div elements all over, which it absoluetly gives the look desired but as far as screen reader go, div elements are not descriptive. Thats where semantic elements come in, replacing a div element with a header tag will give the user an understanding that this would be the top of the page, maybe with the title of the page or the companies name- "h1". Using semantic elements is a start, using them in a logical structure is just as important. When the pages source code is "screen-reader" accessable it would also be legible to not only fellow developers but nearly anyone even those who are not fluent is any programming languages. Refactoring the CSS consisted of consolidating specific styling used by multiple elements to prevent writing it for each individual element taking up unneccesary lines of code. CSS should also follow a logical structure and each developer may have different rules but a standard is followed by the majority. To get a better understanding, take a look at the before and after on both the index.html and the style.css.

# Challenge #1 HTML, CSS, and Git
    
    Basic fundamentals are being tested. HTML, CSS, and Git are
as stated by nearly all my peers..."The bones", "The Skeletol Structure", "The concrete slab used as the base". In this specific assignment "Horiseon" has requested 
that their company WebPage be updated to meet todays standards. Most companies have a common goal for their WebPage. That goal is to create a fully functional WebPage, while containing accessability to all potential users, whether the user is visually impared needing screen readers, hearing impared needing a visual understanding, or maybe the user is not tech savvy and navigating the internet can be like a new language to them. There are all sorts of ways to ensure that a webpage can be used by any user that comes across it. 

# What the World Wide Web has become

    Today marks a completely new and different way of how the "Internet" and what makes up the contents ('WebPages') of this powerful/remarkable tool. This specific industry of Web Development and of course all other 'Tech' has made it to a place never believed to be possible. The time frame that it tok to get to where it is today is quite overwhelming to think about where it will be in the next 1 to 10 years.
